An app built using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of all time favorite movies.
When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Under every gif, rating is desplayed (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
